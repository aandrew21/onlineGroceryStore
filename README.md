Security Considerations
HTTPS: Ensure HTTPS is enabled in production to securely handle user data.

Sensitive Data: Paystack API keys are securely stored in the environment settings.

Deployment
Deploy the project to a server using platforms like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.

Set up your PostgreSQL database and ensure all environment variables (such as PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY) are configured securely.

Ensure your application uses HTTPS for secure connections.

Future Improvements
Add reviews and ratings for products.

Implement discounts and promo codes.

Include an order history page for customers.

Add user profiles with additional details (e.g., delivery address).
